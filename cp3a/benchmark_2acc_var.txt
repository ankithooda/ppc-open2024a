  Your code used 1.085 sec of wallclock time, and 5.708 sec of CPU time
  ≈ you used 5.3 simultaneous hardware threads on average

  The total number of clock cycles was 20.8 billion
  ≈ CPU was running at 3.6 GHz

  The CPU executed 18.42 billion machine-language instructions
  ≈ 16.98 instructions per nanosecond
  ≈ 0.89 instructions per clock cycle

  11.2% of the instructions were branches
  and 0.4% of them were mispredicted
